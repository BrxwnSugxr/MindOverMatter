## Description

Post COVID made us understand 2 core concepts. 
1 - Mental Health is an inclide statically 1 in 2 people have mental health issues and its a taboo thing to ask 
2- technology is a way to communicate globally and locally from the comfort of your home

we are here to upskill indivuals on social behaviour concepts 

The team that made the original app is credited below and its workflow was coordinated on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/BrxwnSugxr/MindOverMatter).

While making the app, we made fetch calls to third-party APIs like `?`, learned about a framework called `AntD`
